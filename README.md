# Simple Landing Page

Link to the page: https://landing-page-95.herokuapp.com/

This is my first landing page made using ReactJs, NextJs, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and reactstrap. The landing page is about an app that is in development. It has 4 separates page:

1. Home page
2. Contact page
3. Signup page

Some illustrations are taken from https://undraw.co/ and combined using plugins in Figma. 



**Please feel free to comment about the code or anything, I'm new to ReactJs and web programming and looking to improve myself. **
